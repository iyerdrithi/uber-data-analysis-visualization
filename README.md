# uber-data-analysis-visualization

This Data Science project was designed by DataFlair in their series of R projects. This project was more of a data visualization project using the ggplot2 library to understand the data and developing an intuition to understand riders who take trips. The dataset used in this project is the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset.

The dataset is seperated by month and each has the following columns:
Date/Time: The date and time of the Uber pickup
Lat: The latitude of the Uber pickup
Lon: The longitude of the Uber pickup
Base: The TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup
